Do you want to turn on / off your TV, AirCon (AC) using Amazon Alexa? Checkout my latest project https://irdevkit.com/RFLink ESP8266 WeMos Shield
============================

This shield is used to hold [RFLink][4] Software with WeMos ESP8266 boards it has just few minimal features.
- I2C Pullups placement
- Classic I2C 128x64 OLED connector
- Placement for Aurel RF transceiver [RTX-MID-3V][5] module
- Placement for choosing single Wire, SMA or u-FL Antenna type
- WS2812B Type LED for visual indication

You can find more information on WeMos on their [site][1], it's really well documented.
I now use WeMos boards instead of NodeMCU's one because they're just smaller, features remains the same, but I also suspect WeMos regulator far better quality than the one used on NodeMCU that are just fake of originals AMS117 3V3.

**Boards are ordered as testing from OSHPark, I did not fully tested them yet, I will update as soon has I got them in my hands. Use at your own risks**
